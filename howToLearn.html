                <h2>Derek Muller's Theory</h2>
                    <p>The first video follows Derek Muller as he goes around and questions people on where trees get their mass. He asks questions that make them elaborate and think deeper about the subject. He also brings in a theory from a past expert and the experiment that they conducted. The expert he referenced was Johann Baptista van Helmholt who did the soil pot experiment to see how much soil was absorbed by the tree he grew in the pot. </p>
                    <p>He slowly nudges them to an answer before revealing the solution. This forces them to put effort towards the solution, meaning that they learn the solution. </p>
                    <p>Trees are largely made up of carbon dioxide. Most people presume they are made up of water or they get nutrients from the soil. </p>
      
                    <p>If you just say the correct solution, they think that they are learning, but in reality they aren't learning anything because they are just being handed the solution. By starting with a question that seems obvious and making people work through the question, the people being questioned as well as the viewers of his videos are engaging with the subject more. This means that they are actually struggling and learning the material.</p>

                    <h3>Types of Mindsets</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <dt>Fixed Mindset: Intelligence is a fixed trait</dt>
                                <dd>Some students believe that intelligence is a fixed trait, meaning that they believe that you only have a certain amount of intelligence and you can't move beyond that amount. These students are afraid to try to learn because they don't want to seem dumb.</dd>
                            </li>
                  
                            <li>
                                <dt>Growth Mindset: Intelligence can be developed</dt>
                                <dd>Believe that intelligence has the ability to develop through time and hard work.</dd>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <dl>
                            <dt><h3>Effort</h3></dt>
                            <dd>Effort is bad in a fixed minset. If you have the ability, it should come naturally.</dd>
                            <dd>Effort in a growth mindset is key. It is what allows them to succeed.</dd>
                            <dt><h3>Setbacks</h3></dt>
                            <dd>In a fixed mindset, a setback is a failure that sows their deficiencies. They try to hide the setbacks so others don't see. </dd>
                            <dd>In a growth mindset, a setback is a natural part of the learning process and is something to learn from. It is not something to be ashamed of. </dd>
                            <dt><h3>Praise</h3></dt>
                            <dd>Praising students abilities puts them into a fixed mindset.</dd>
                            <dt><h3>Other points</h3></dt>
                            <dd>You can teach a growth mindset.
                            It is never too late to change to a growth mindset.

                            <li>The only goal of students with this mindset was to learn, without caring about how they looked to others</li>
                            <li>Grades improved throughout the year.</li>
                            <li><b>Goal:</b> Learn at all costs.</li>

            <h2>Commonalities between the two theories: Effort</h2>
                <p>
                In Carol Dweck's talk, she says that in a growth mindset, the person views  effort as the only way to learn anything. She then says that while learning, one must view setbacks as the natural process to learning instead of as a failure that must be hidden.
                Derek Muller's videos demonstrate this by leading people through the ideal learning process. The people that he interviews must work through the question that he asks, and face multiple set backs in order to finally reach the solution.
                This helps the student to learn the fact or material more thoroughly rather than if they were just told the answer.
