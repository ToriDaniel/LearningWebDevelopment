                <h2>What are the pro's and cons of 3 visualizations techniques discussed in chapter 8? </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Seasonal subseries charts</b> are great for comparing small populations to larger populations but if they are used on their own, they can be misleading since the entire population is not being taken into account.</li>
                    <li><b>Calculating Indexes</b>is a great way to present itme series data and relative change. The downside is that the graphics can sometimes be left looking cluttered so it is necessary to break it up into multiple smaller graphics. </li>
                    <li><b>Color Coded Horizon Charts</b> are great for taking a lot of data and making it aesthetically pleasing as well as easy to take in. The downfall is for anyone with any degree of colorblindness will not be able to read it.</li>
