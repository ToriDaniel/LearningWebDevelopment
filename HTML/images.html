        This is an example of the proper code used to insert a picture into a webpage. All images must include an "image" tag. You do not need to include a closing tag, but the image tag must include 2 attributes: 
        <ul>
        <li> src (tells the browser where it can find the image file)</li>
        <li> alt (provides a text description of the image if you cannot see it) </li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>You can adjust the width and height of the image by typing "width=" and "height=" and set the 2 to your personal preference. </p>
    
        <p>The most important thing while inserting an image into a webpage is making sure the image link in your source is the link to the image itself, not a general webpage where you saw the image included. You must open the image in its own tab and access the link to the image alone. </p>
    
        <p> After including the correct source information and a text description of the image in case the user cannot see the image, you must close the image command with a backslash and closing bracket. </p>
