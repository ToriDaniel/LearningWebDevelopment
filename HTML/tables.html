    This is an example of the proper code used to create a table in HTML format.
    While it is just a basic table, it covers the fundamentals of tables. The table element initiates the beginning of the table. Each row starts with the "tr" command, which stands for "table row"; to start a column, type in "th scope=" and write "col". Each column must be closed with a backslash and "th" tag.  
</p>
<p>
    After creating all of the columns and rows of the table, you must indicate what you want to put into each cell of the table. This is done with the "td" tag, which stands for "table data". You must enter this tag for each cell in the table. Even if you want to make a cell empty, you still must use a table data or table heading tag to represent the presence of an empty cell. If you do not indicate this, the table will not render correctly. </p>

    Although the example shown is just a basic table, it shows how to correctly code the essential concepts of a table such as rows and columns and all of the data included within the rows and columns. In this specific example, the table is showing the attendance for a concert festival over the course of two days. The columns display which days attendance was taken and the rows indicate how many men and women attended on each day.
