        <h1>Links</h1>
        <link href="htmlStyle.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
        <h2>Uses</h2>
        <p>Links are used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>move from one webpage to another</li>
            <li>switch between pages of the same website</li>
            <li>jump to a different area of a webpage</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h2>Synthax</h2>
            <img src="images/Links.png"/>
            <p> The address in the quotes after href= is the location of the image that you would like to use. </p>
        
            <p><b>Tip:</b> One of the common mistakes that my partner and I made when adding the image's address is just putting the name of the image without ensuring that the image is within the same folder as the .html file.</p>
