            <h2>inner join</h2>
                <p>Inner join is when you combine two tables using a common column to determine how they overlap. In the ON part of the synthax for INNER JOIN, you would specify which column the two tables have in common. If there are records in one of the tables selected that do not align with any of the records of the other table, they won't be shown. </p>
                
                <p>Another way to think about this concept aside from the typical venn diagram structure would be to image a crossword puzzle. Two words are joined by a common letter, similar to how two tables are joined by a common column. There are also no words set off to the side because they aren't included unless they fit into the corssword puzzle. This represents how if there are records in one table that do not have a common record for the joined column, they are ommited from the query results.  </p>
