            <h2>Ordinal Scales</h2>
                <p>Handles the left and right positioning of bars and labels along the x-axis.Ordinal scales are used for categories that have some form of order to them. This ensures that when updating the graph, the bars remain in the same order. </p>
        
            <h2>Bands</h2>
                <p>Bands ensure that when data is grouped together for display, they are banded together evenly. </p>
        
            <h2>How to update data</h2>
                <p>For updating data where the data values are all updated and the number of values remain the same:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Modify the values in the dataset</li>
                        <li>Rebind the new values to the existing elements</li>
                        <li>Set new attribute values to update the visual display</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>For this update to happen, there needs to be some sort of "trigger" or event, such as clicking on a button.</p>
